# maim

A WIP remake of maim that uses cimg instead of imlib2.

- [X] Convert X11 formats to a format cimg understands. (Planning on just supporting 16, 24, and 32 bit images.)
- [X] Link with slop library.
- [ ] Option parsing.
- [ ] Smartly constraining selection to prevent crashing.
- [ ] Masking off-screen buffers.
- [ ] Man-pages.
- [ ] Actual std::cout support.

Lots still to do.
